# Skotels
<h3><b>Software Design and Architecture</b></h3>
 <h4>Project for mapping and navigating through hotels in Skopje<h4>

## 1. Introduction

  <p>Finding a hotel can be tricky, especially last minute. Thankfully, there is a whole industry based on this issue. There are two main types of hotel applications. The first are the classic big companies like Marriot or Hilton and the second are more independent operations like Airbnb or Booking.com. Knowing that Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, is frequently visited by tourists from all over the world we decided to develop a web application which will show available accommodation in the city.
  
  The purpose of this document is to give a general insight of the scope and the requirements for the Skotels Web Application and to provide a base for the foundation of the project. The main goal of the project is to design a scalable and extensible system for managing the hotel activities. 
  
  The system will provide the information regarding the different types of accommodation in Skopje that are available and their status specific to availability. This web application will be intended for those who would like to find accommodation in Skopje. It will use navigation and geolocation to show all the hotels and motels in the area.
  
  Mainly, the code will be written in HTML and the Java Spring Framework and we will use non-relational databases - MongoDB to store information about the accommodation. Open data from OpenStreetMap will be used to fill the database.
  
  The developers and the testers can use this document as a reference for developing the design and test plan documents.</p>
